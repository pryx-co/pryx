{"id":"pryx-2yd4","title":"User Guide: Natural Language Cron","description":"## Overview\nCreate user-facing documentation for the natural language cron parser. This guide helps users understand what patterns work and how to use them effectively.\n\n## Documentation Structure\n\n### 1. Quick Start Guide\n```markdown\n# Natural Language Scheduling\n\nPryx understands human-readable time expressions. Instead of writing \n`0 9 * * 1-5`, just say \"every weekday at 9am\".\n\n## Quick Examples\n\n| What you want | What you type |\n|--------------|---------------|\n| Remind me in 30 minutes | \"in 30 minutes\" |\n| Daily morning briefing | \"every day at 9am\" |\n| Weekday evening check | \"every weekday at 8pm\" |\n| Monday team sync | \"every Monday at 10am\" |\n| Tomorrow afternoon | \"tomorrow at 2pm\" |\n```\n\n### 2. Supported Patterns Reference\n\n#### One-Shot Reminders\nThese run once at a specific time:\n- \"in 30 minutes\" - 30 minutes from now\n- \"in 2 hours\" - 2 hours from now\n- \"tomorrow at 9am\" - Tomorrow at 9:00 AM\n- \"tomorrow at 14:30\" - Tomorrow at 2:30 PM\n\n#### Recurring Schedules\nThese repeat on a schedule:\n- \"every 5 minutes\" - Every 5 minutes\n- \"every hour\" - Every hour\n- \"every day at 9am\" - Daily at 9:00 AM\n- \"every weekday at 8pm\" - Monday-Friday at 8:00 PM\n- \"every Monday\" - Every Monday at midnight\n- \"every Monday at 3pm\" - Every Monday at 3:00 PM\n- \"weekends at 10am\" - Saturday and Sunday at 10:00 AM\n\n#### Time Formats\n- **12-hour**: \"9am\", \"3:30pm\", \"12pm\" (noon), \"12am\" (midnight)\n- **24-hour**: \"09:00\", \"15:30\", \"14:00\"\n- **Keywords**: \"noon\" (12pm), \"midnight\" (12am)\n\n#### Days of the Week\n- Full names: \"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", etc.\n- Abbreviations: \"Mon\", \"Tue\", etc.\n- Groups: \"weekdays\" (Mon-Fri), \"weekends\" (Sat-Sun)\n\n### 3. Limitations and Edge Cases\n\n#### What Doesn't Work\nThese patterns are NOT supported:\n- ❌ \"every payday\" (business logic)\n- ❌ \"if it's raining\" (conditions)\n- ❌ \"every 3-5 minutes\" (variable intervals)\n- ❌ \"9am Tokyo time\" (use timezone parameter instead)\n- ❌ \"every day except weekends\" (exceptions)\n- ❌ \"after the next holiday\" (calendar events)\n\n#### Timezone Handling\n- Natural language parsing does NOT support timezones in text\n- Use the `tz` parameter for timezone specification:\n  ```\n  \"every day at 9am\" with tz=\"America/New_York\"\n  ```\n- Default timezone is the server's local timezone\n\n#### Precision Notes\n- \"every day at 9am\" runs at 9:00:00 AM\n- \"every 5 minutes\" runs at :00, :05, :10, etc.\n- One-shot times are precise to the second\n\n### 4. Troubleshooting Guide\n\n#### Pattern Not Recognized\nIf your pattern isn't recognized:\n1. Check the supported patterns list above\n2. Try rephrasing (e.g., \"every Monday\" instead of \"weekly on Monday\")\n3. Use standard cron syntax as fallback: `0 9 * * 1`\n\n#### Common Mistakes\n- ❌ \"every 30 mins\" → ✅ \"every 30 minutes\"\n- ❌ \"9AM\" → ✅ \"9am\" or \"9AM\" (case insensitive, but be consistent)\n- ❌ \"weekdays at 9\" → ✅ \"weekdays at 9am\"\n\n### 5. Examples by Use Case\n\n#### Daily Standups\n```\n\"every weekday at 9am\" - Daily standup reminder\n```\n\n#### Health Checks\n```\n\"every 5 minutes\" - Frequent health check\n\"every hour\" - Hourly status report\n```\n\n#### Weekly Reviews\n```\n\"every Friday at 4pm\" - Weekly wrap-up\n\"every Monday at 9am\" - Week planning\n```\n\n#### One-Shot Reminders\n```\n\"in 30 minutes\" - Quick reminder\n\"tomorrow at 2pm\" - Future task\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] User guide created in `docs/guides/cron-natural-language.md`\n- [ ] Quick reference table included\n- [ ] All supported patterns documented with examples\n- [ ] Limitations clearly stated\n- [ ] Troubleshooting section included\n- [ ] Cross-reference to SYSTEM.md for AI capabilities\n\n## Labels\ndocumentation, user-guide, cron, scheduling","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"join.mantap@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-29T20:01:17.319518+07:00","created_by":"irfandi marsya","updated_at":"2026-01-29T20:01:32.598704+07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"pryx-2yd4","depends_on_id":"pryx-tx8o","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2026-01-29T20:01:45.697877+07:00","created_by":"irfandi marsya"}]}

{"id":"pryx-ygl7","title":"Scheduler Integration","description":"## Overview\nIntegrate the natural language cron parser with Pryx's scheduler service. The parser should seamlessly convert human-readable expressions into cron jobs.\n\n## Integration Points\n\n### 1. API Integration\n\n#### Add Job Endpoint\n```typescript\n// POST /api/cron/jobs\ninterface AddJobRequest {\n  name: string;\n  schedule: string | CronSchedule;  // Accept natural language or structured\n  payload: Payload;\n  sessionTarget: \"main\" | \"isolated\";\n  tz?: string;  // Timezone for natural language parsing\n}\n\n// Example requests\n{\n  \"name\": \"Morning Briefing\",\n  \"schedule\": \"every day at 9am\",  // Natural language\n  \"tz\": \"America/New_York\",        // Optional timezone\n  \"payload\": {\n    \"kind\": \"agentTurn\",\n    \"message\": \"Generate morning briefing\"\n  },\n  \"sessionTarget\": \"isolated\"\n}\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"Health Check\",\n  \"schedule\": \"every 5 minutes\",   // Natural language\n  \"payload\": {\n    \"kind\": \"systemEvent\",\n    \"text\": \"Run health check\"\n  },\n  \"sessionTarget\": \"main\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Response Handling\n```typescript\ninterface AddJobResponse {\n  success: boolean;\n  job?: CronJob;\n  error?: {\n    code: string;\n    message: string;\n    suggestion?: string;\n  };\n}\n\n// Success\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"job\": {\n    \"id\": \"job-123\",\n    \"name\": \"Morning Briefing\",\n    \"schedule\": { kind: \"cron\", expr: \"0 9 * * *\", tz: \"America/New_York\" },\n    \"nextRun\": \"2026-01-30T14:00:00Z\"\n  }\n}\n\n// Error\n{\n  \"success\": false,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"UNSUPPORTED_PATTERN\",\n    \"message\": \"'every payday' is not supported\",\n    \"suggestion\": \"Try: 'every 2 weeks on Friday at 9am'\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. CLI Integration\n\n#### Cron Add Command\n```bash\n# Natural language schedule\npryx cron add \\\n  --name \"Morning Briefing\" \\\n  --schedule \"every day at 9am\" \\\n  --tz \"America/New_York\" \\\n  --message \"Generate morning briefing\"\n\n# One-shot reminder\npryx cron add \\\n  --name \"Meeting Reminder\" \\\n  --schedule \"in 30 minutes\" \\\n  --session main \\\n  --system-event \"Meeting starts in 5 minutes\"\n\n# With validation error\npryx cron add \\\n  --name \"Payday Task\" \\\n  --schedule \"every payday\"\n# Error: 'every payday' is not supported. Try: 'every 2 weeks on Friday at 9am'\n```\n\n### 3. Service Integration\n\n#### Cron Service Interface\n```typescript\ninterface CronService {\n  addJob(request: AddJobRequest): Promise\u003cAddJobResponse\u003e;\n  parseSchedule(input: string, tz?: string): ParseResult;\n}\n\nclass CronServiceImpl implements CronService {\n  private parser: NaturalLanguageCronParser;\n  private scheduler: Scheduler;\n  \n  async addJob(request: AddJobRequest): Promise\u003cAddJobResponse\u003e {\n    // Parse natural language if string\n    let schedule: CronSchedule;\n    if (typeof request.schedule === \"string\") {\n      const parseResult = this.parser.parse(request.schedule, request.tz);\n      if (!parseResult.success) {\n        return { success: false, error: parseResult.error };\n      }\n      schedule = parseResult.schedule;\n    } else {\n      schedule = request.schedule;\n    }\n    \n    // Create job with parsed schedule\n    const job = await this.scheduler.createJob({\n      name: request.name,\n      schedule,\n      payload: request.payload,\n      sessionTarget: request.sessionTarget\n    });\n    \n    return { success: true, job };\n  }\n  \n  parseSchedule(input: string, tz?: string): ParseResult {\n    return this.parser.parse(input, tz);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Agent Tool Integration\n\n#### Cron Tool Update\n```typescript\n// In agent tools, support natural language\nconst CronToolSchema = Type.Object({\n  action: stringEnum(CRON_ACTIONS),\n  // ... other fields\n  schedule: Type.Union([\n    Type.String({ description: \"Natural language schedule (e.g., 'every day at 9am')\" }),\n    Type.Object({}) // Structured schedule object\n  ]),\n  tz: Type.Optional(Type.String({ description: \"Timezone (e.g., 'America/New_York')\" }))\n});\n\n// Tool description update\nconst description = `Manage Gateway cron jobs...\n\nSCHEDULE FORMAT:\nYou can use natural language for schedules:\n- \"every 5 minutes\" - Every 5 minutes\n- \"every day at 9am\" - Daily at 9:00 AM\n- \"every weekday at 8pm\" - Monday-Friday at 8:00 PM\n- \"every Monday\" - Every Monday\n- \"in 30 minutes\" - One-shot in 30 minutes\n- \"tomorrow at 2pm\" - One-shot tomorrow at 2:00 PM\n\nFor unsupported patterns, the system will suggest alternatives.\n`;\n```\n\n### 5. Validation Pipeline\n\n```\nUser Input\n    ↓\nPre-validation (syntax check)\n    ↓\nNatural Language Parser\n    ↓\n┌─────────────┴─────────────┐\n│                           │\nSuccess                 Failure\n│                           │\nStructured            Error Handler\nSchedule                  │\n│                      Return\n│                      Error + Suggestion\n│\nPost-validation (schedule validity)\n    ↓\nScheduler Registration\n    ↓\nJob Created\n```\n\n### 6. Timezone Handling\n\n```typescript\ninterface ParseOptions {\n  tz?: string;  // IANA timezone identifier\n  referenceTime?: number;  // Base time for relative expressions (default: now)\n}\n\n// Examples\nparse(\"every day at 9am\", { tz: \"America/New_York\" });\n// Returns: { kind: \"cron\", expr: \"0 9 * * *\", tz: \"America/New_York\" }\n\nparse(\"tomorrow at noon\", { tz: \"Asia/Tokyo\" });\n// Returns: { kind: \"at\", atMs: \u003ctomorrow noon in Tokyo\u003e }\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] API endpoint accepts natural language schedules\n- [ ] CLI commands support natural language schedules\n- [ ] Cron service integrates parser seamlessly\n- [ ] Agent tools updated with natural language support\n- [ ] Timezone handling works correctly\n- [ ] Error responses include helpful suggestions\n- [ ] Validation pipeline implemented\n- [ ] Documentation updated with integration examples\n\n## Dependencies\n- pryx-tx8o: SYSTEM.md Template (for agent tool descriptions)\n- pryx-\u003cparser-task\u003e: Natural Language Parser Implementation\n\n## Labels\nintegration, cron, scheduler, api, cli","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"join.mantap@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-29T20:01:19.179435+07:00","created_by":"irfandi marsya","updated_at":"2026-01-29T20:01:35.004344+07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"pryx-ygl7","depends_on_id":"pryx-uosk","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-29T20:01:43.703766+07:00","created_by":"irfandi marsya"},{"issue_id":"pryx-ygl7","depends_on_id":"pryx-99zi","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-29T20:01:45.157579+07:00","created_by":"irfandi marsya"}]}
